# ethical-hacking-journey

So I’ve decided to document my ethical hacking journey — both for myself and for anyone else following a similar path. Each week I’ll share what I’ve studied, the resources I’ve used, and the challenges I’ve faced along the way.

I find that I learn best when I can dive deep and explore topics at my own pace, which isn’t always possible in group settings where the focus can be more surface-level. Documenting my journey will also be great for looking back later, as you don’t realise how much progress you’ve made until you step back and review it all.

If you’re reading this, I hope you enjoy following along as much as I’m enjoying the process! :)
