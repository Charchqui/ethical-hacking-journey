# Week 3: Ethical Hacking Journey

## What I've Learned This Week:

- XSS
- OWASP
- SQLi
- CSRF

## Weekly Reflection:

This week, I decided to buckle down and focus on learning security concepts. These topics kept popping up while I was studying other subjects, but I had been pushing them aside, thinking I would address them later. The sheer amount of material is pretty overwhelming, and I often find myself thinking, "Wait... doesn’t [something else] do this as well?" Why are there so many things that seem to do the same thing?

I’ve already finished Weeks 3 and 4 on my timeline, even though I’m only about halfway through Week 3. So, I’ve been looking into more practical aspects and recapping what I’ve learned by reviewing my notes and watching YouTube videos to solidify my understanding. With this journey, it feels like you pressure yourself to learn everything quickly, but as soon as you step away for a moment, the information just sits there. So, I’ve been trying to let it settle instead of forcing it when I feel a particular subject is challenging me.

## What’s Next:

As I mentioned earlier, I’ve started focusing more on the practical side which is needed as I find myself getting caught up in deep internet research rabbit holes. Moving forward, I’m planning to explore tools like Burp Suite and Juice Shop to put some of this theory to the test.

I’m still yet to find any part of this journey that doesn’t interest me — every day, I’m excited to learn! Until next time :)
