# Week 1: Ethical Hacking Journey

## What I've Learned This Week
- OSI model
- IP addresses (IPv4, IPv6)
- MAC addresses
- Subnetting

## Weekly Reflection

I'm glad I started early with learning about the OSI model because it kept coming up a lot when studying networking. It actually helped me understand other components better by referring back to the model. At first, I thought there was no way Iâ€™d remember all the layers in order â€” but now, I can probably name most of them with an explanation.

IP addresses were more interesting than I expected. Itâ€™s crazy to think that something Iâ€™ve used pretty much my whole life has so much behind it that I never knew. It definitely gave me a new appreciation for how it works.

Subnetting got me into a pickle, though. When I was learning about subnet masks, broadcast addresses, and network addresses, I had to take a break. I watched a couple of YouTube tutorials to get a better grasp, and eventually, I figured it out â€” and actually found it quite fun! Who wouldâ€™ve thought?

I also learned how packets travel from one computer to another, which ties back to the OSI model. You donâ€™t realise how much happens behind the scenes, and how instant it all is. Mad, right?

This journey just keeps getting more intriguing. I find myself watching YouTube videos before bed about how GPUs are made or people building and flipping computers. What a world Iâ€™ve been introduced to!

## Whatâ€™s Next

Iâ€™m planning to finish the Network Essentials segment tomorrow. Iâ€™ve just scratched the surface of **nmap**, so that will definitely be on the agenda. I will also be on my Virtual Machine and have a play around on Linux more this week, also completing more TryHackMe labs which is one of the main places I'm studying. I have done a few on HackTheBox also, but found TryHackMe more beginner friendly, but I hope to integrate more into HackTheBox as I get more knowledgeable.

Thanks for reading! Looking forward to sharing more next week â€” see you then! ðŸ˜Š
