# Week 2: Ethical Hacking Journey

## What I've Learned This Week
- CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)  
- Defense in Depth  
- Firewalls  
- NIST Framework  
- Pyramid of Pain  

## Weekly Reflection

This week, I dove deeper into cybersecurity concepts, building on the networking foundation from last week. I havenâ€™t spent much time on Linux this week, as I want to focus on mastering the basics first. I figure Linux will come up more naturally as I get further along in the journey â€” instead of rushing through basic commands like echo or nmap right now, Iâ€™ll save those for when theyâ€™re more relevant.

I found the regulations section, especially the NIST framework, quite challenging during a TryHackMe room. To help it stick, I watched several YouTube videos explaining it in different ways, which really helped solidify my understanding. Iâ€™m noticing that with more complex topics, using multiple learning resources really makes a difference.

Iâ€™m actually ahead of my weekly roadmap, which feels great because I donâ€™t feel overwhelmed. It means I can take my time with this huge segment without rushing. Also, I was surprised at how competitive I got with the TryHackMe leagues while trying to keep my daily streak going â€” currently up to 16 days!

As I mentioned last week, Iâ€™m still very intrigued, which is a huge green flag for me since I sometimes struggle to focus for hours on such detailed topics. But Iâ€™m loving the information Iâ€™m learning and canâ€™t wait to dive deeper.

## Whatâ€™s Next

Iâ€™m going to keep grinding through the cybersecurity segment because itâ€™s vital for what I want to do. Itâ€™s laying a really strong, secure foundation for the future subjects in my roadmap, so I want to make sure I understand it well before moving on.

Until next week! ðŸ˜Š
