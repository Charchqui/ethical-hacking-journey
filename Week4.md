# Week 4: Ethical Hacking Journey

## What I've Learnt This Week:
- Burp Suite
- Wireshark
- Day-to-day workflows in cybersecurity
- Reinforced knowledge from previous weeks

## Weekly Reflection:

This week has felt more like solidifying what I already know. I watched and recapped the Google Cybersecurity Certificate YouTube video (15.5 hours long), and it was nice to go over the material — it felt like I already understood the majority of it. I also reviewed Python and other foundational topics.

It’s been great to revisit things and see how everything is starting to fit together more clearly, especially after learning related concepts that complement each other. This journey continues to excite me — I’ve discovered that I have a strong interest in ethical hacking, but an even deeper passion for reverse hacking and engineering.

Also, I’ve hit **Day 30** on my TryHackMe streak!

## What's Next:

I’ll be away for work next week and won’t be near my computer. Still, I plan to keep my TryHackMe streak going, even if it’s just completing a slide in a room.

I’m treating this coming week as a “reading week.” I’ve tracked down some of the best cybersecurity books in PDF format and plan to read through them. I’m also purchasing a few titles that seem worth diving deeper into — more than just a surface-level read.

Until next time! :)
